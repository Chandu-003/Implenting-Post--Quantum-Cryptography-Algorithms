# Implementing Post Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms

## Overview
This project, titled **"Implementing Post Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms,"** represents a significant milestone in addressing the vulnerabilities of classical cryptographic systems in the face of emerging quantum technologies. With advancements in quantum computing, traditional encryption methods such as **RSA** and **ECC** face obsolescence. This project explores and implements **CRYSTALS-Kyber** (Key Encapsulation Mechanism) and **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** (Digital Signatures), two of the leading quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms, using the **Liboqs** library.

The integration focuses on securing web server communications via a modified version of **OpenSSL** and **Nginx**, enabling encrypted communication resistant to quantum threats.
